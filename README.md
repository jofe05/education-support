## Definitions

Task: An activity that a teacher can perform to gain points. Each task has an amount of points associated. 

Path: Is a set of tasks. Path are unique. A path cannot have a duplicated task. Is generated by a csv file, present in the same folder. 
 
## Data Structures 

**tasksDic** is a dictionary with all the tasks names (key) and the corresponding points (values). See table below:

| Tasks| Value  |
| -----|:------:|
|  B2  |  3000  |
|  B3  |  1496  |
|  B4  |  744   |
|  D2  |  2000  |
|  D3  |  996   |
|  D4  |  660   |
|  D5  |  436   |
|  D6  |  392   |
|  D7  |  353   |
|  F2  |  1600  |
|  F3  |  796   |
|  F4  |  527   |
|  F5  |  347   |
|  F6  |  312   |
|  F7  |  279   |
|  F8  |  250   |
|  H2  |  1600  |
|  H3  |  796   |
|  H4  |  527   |
|  H5  |  347   |
|  H6  |  312   |
|  H7  |  279   |
|  H8  |  250   |
|  H9  |  234   |
|  J2  |  3000  |
|  J3  |  1496  |
|  J4  |  744   |
|  J5  |  368   |
|  J6  |  303   |
|  J7  |  248   |
|  J8  |  222   |



**paths** is 2 dimensional list containing all posible paths. 
Example: If I want to get the path number 456:

```python

    >> i = 456
    >> print("Path " + str(i-1) + ": " + str(paths[i]))
    --- output ---
    >> Path 455: ['B3', 'B4', 'D2', 'D3', 'D4', 'D5', 'D6', 'D7', 'F4', 'F5', 'F6', 'F7', 'F8', 'H2', 'H4', 'H5', 'H6', 'H7', 'H8', 'H9', 'J4', 'J5', 'J7', 'J8']

```

## Functions

#### def howManyStartWith(task, paths):
Receives a task and all paths. Returns how many paths start with a specific task.

#### def isContained(paths):
Receives all paths. Checks if a path is contained in others. Returns a 2 dimensional list, with all the list where a specific path is contained. 

#### def createGraph(path, name): COMMENTED
Receives a path and a name. Creates a graph for that path. 

#### def showPaths(paths): COMMENTED
Receives all paths. Prints all paths. 

#### def pathDifference(paths, index): 
Recieves all paths and list of paths that are not contained in other paths. Returns a 2 dimensional list with how many elements differ from the other paths

## Requirements

* Python 3+ 
* Graphviz (To generate the graphs)
